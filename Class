CLASSES
They are used to create one or more objects. The object is used by the program to do things.
You can define 2 main areas of a class which are created:
  1. What an object will have --> Called an Instance property.
      Instance properties describes the property - Data about property
      eg. Person (properties): name, height, age.
  2. What an object will do --> Called an Instance method.
      Instance methods use instances properties to get their results. 
      eg. Person (mehtods): run, walk, jump. talk [their actions and behariors.]
      
      
 How to create a class?
  First use the class keyword. 
  Second use the class name ==> class Name (first letter capped)
  Third use parentheses containing the class definition. 
  Fourth A class should have a constructor. Which is a method run once when object is created (sets up object). 
  Result ==>
    class Name {
      definition
      constructor {
      -BEHAVES LIKE A METHOD AND IS USED TO SET UP THE OBJECT-
      }
    }
    
**ONCE THE CLASS IS CREATED AN OBJECT FOR THAT CLASS CAN BE CREATED. 
  First create a variable
    let variable name
  Second set variable equal to the new class created using the 'new' keyword and objects name
    let variable name = new ojbect name
  Third add parenthese to call the constructor method and set object up.
    let variable name = new object name();
